# 30 Minute Challenge

Create a todo list from scratch.

## What we are looking for

- Using CSS without a library like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or similar. We recommend using CSS modules or just CSS files.
- Using native and your own UI. Not Material UI, Ant design, or similar.
- How you would handle an input and-or form in React using hooks.
- How similar you can make it to a loosly defined design.
- Make it responsive: 320px is the minimal device width you need to support.
- Use clear HTML5 semantics.

## User stories

- As a user, I can add a todo task and see a list of them.
- As a user, I can mark a todo task as "done".
- As a user, I can see what tasks are done and move them back or delete them.

## Use the design

Many times, we are given a loosy defined mockup design that isn't showing us the proper dimensions or how it would look like on a smaller device. This is one of those scenarios.

> Sometimes we are given nothing but a rough sketch if even anything. Other times, we are working with designers with design documents and UI libraries.

## Note

- There can be bugs! Focus on the user stories first. Bugs are OK as long as the user stories are in focus!
- Note down the improvements and questions you would have to improve the user experience. I give you one for free: "What happens if the user adds tasks that are N characters so the list items overflow?". These are the types of questions you can add without actually fixing them - focus on the user stories as given: improvements comes in another iteration.
- No need for extreme component writing: you don't need a component for a button, a list item, a input etc. Focus on what the user would see and interact with first, not how a developer would see how you build a UI library.

## Clear expectations

- Rather go overtime (not more than 1 hour total) to get as close to the design as possible.
- The user stories must be all fulfilled.
- Give a note with some UI improvements.

## How we assess it

- We don't look at the code to begin with. We solely look at it from a user's perspective
