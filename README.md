# 30 Minute Challenge

Create a todo list from scratch.

## What we are looking for

- Using CSS without a library like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or similar. We recommend using CSS modules or just CSS files.
- Using native and your own UI. Not Material UI, Ant design, or similar.
- How you would handle an input and-or form in React using hooks.

## User stories

## Note

- There can be bugs! Focus on the user stories first. Bugs are OK as long as the user stories are in focus!
- Note down the improvements and questions you would have to improve the user experience. I give you one for free: "What happens if the user adds tasks that are N characters so the list items overflow?". These are the types of questions you can add without actually fixing them - focus on the user stories as given: improvements comes in another iteration.
